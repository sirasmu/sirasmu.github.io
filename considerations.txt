Assignment 5 consideration

 - Colours
	I have chosen the website to be in black and white to match the logo. Black and white
	has high contrast and thus makes it easier to distinguish between the elements/text. 
	I use deepskyblue nuances. I initially wanted to use cyan, but it did not stand
	in high enough contrast against the white background. I chose this colour because
	it is similar to the blue colour in the photomanipulation and animations.
	The navigation bar underlines logo.
	I use a grey box for the contact section. The darker colour gives stability to the
	site by being a visual foundation. The grey box also marks that it is seperate from
	the rest of the site and that the contact details belong together.
 - Font
	I use Verdana as the only font for the website. This is because Verdana has high
	readability. The spacing is smaller for the logo text. This is to give it a more
	massive look to match the large black circle in the logo. Large text does not need
	an as high letter spacing as small text to be readable.
	The navigation bars text has a higher spacing. This is to make it look less cramped.
	I use different header sizes to aid catching the readers attention.
 - Other
	I decided to keep the site narrow. This is partly because I want the navigation bar
	to compliment the logo. It is also because it is easier to read the text when the word
	count per line is not too high.
	The navigation bar is mostly to get an overview on what can be found on the site.
	It would be more relevant it the site had more content.
	I have tried to position the animations so the character seemed centered. The actual
	dimensions of the gif files did not matter in the centering.
	I chose to use a carousel to make the site more orderly. It signals that the content
	belong together and lessen to problem with different height and width format of the
	images and the audio player.
